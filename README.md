# Cat and Dog Image Classification with SVM

## Project Description
This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The aim is to develop a robust image classification model that can accurately distinguish between these two animal categories.

## Data Analysis
The Kaggle dataset containing images of cats and dogs was analyzed to identify patterns and characteristics that can aid in classification.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing operations such as image resizing, normalization, and classification of datasets into training and testing sets were performed.

## Feature Extraction
Relevant features were extracted from the images to serve as input for the SVM model.

## Model Implementation
An SVM model for image classification was designed and trained using the selected features.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Fine-Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was explored to optimize the SVM model for enhanced performance.

## Knowledge Gained
- **Image Classification**: Techniques for creating image classification models using machine learning.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Understanding of SVM for binary classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Skills in preparing image data for machine learning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use of metrics to evaluate and interpret model performance.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Insights into real-world dataset construction and considerations.

## About the Internship
This project was undertaken during a machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I gained hands-on experience with image classification and SVMs.
